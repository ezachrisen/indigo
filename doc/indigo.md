# Indigo Rules Engine Types

This chapter is a deeper dive into how Indigo is organized. 

## The Engine Types

Indigo's rules engine is specified by an interface called Engine, which is composed of two interfaces, a Compiler and an Evaluator. The Compiler interface specifies the Compile method, and Evaluator specifies the Eval method. 

The DefaultEngine struct type implements the Engine interface, and most users will use this type. Since it implements Engine, DefaultEngine implements both Compile and Evaluate. Alternate implementations are possible, including rule evaluators that do not support compilation, for example. 

The engine types are concerned with processing groups of rules organized in a hierarchies. The engine types **do not** concern themselves with the exact nature of the expressions being compiled or evaluated. Instead, they rely on the expression types for that. 

## The Expression Types 
There are two expression interfaces, ExpressionEvaluator, which specifies the evaluation of a single expression, and ExpressionCompiler, which specifies the compilation of a single expression. 

These two interfaces are combined in the ExpressionCompilerEvaluator. 

The indigo/cel.Evaluator implements the ExpressionCompilerEvaluator.

Users of Indigo do not need to interact directly with expression compilation or evaluation; the DefaultEngine handles this. 

## Rule ownership 

Rules are owned by the Go code that calls Indigo engine methods. The indigo.DefaultEngine does NOT store or maintain rules. It is the responsibility of the calling code to be goroutine-safe and to persist rule data for as long as it is needed in the life of the application. 

During compilation, an Engine may update a rule by setting the Program field to the compilation output of the rule. The Engine may require that data later during the evaluation phase. It is the responsibility of the calling code to ensure that the Program data is not tampered with. 

## Using a Non-CEL Evaluator

There are several Go implementations of scripting languages, such as Javscript implemented by [Otto](https://github.com/robertkrimen/otto), and Lua. These languages are good choices for rule evaluation as well. 

To illustrate how Indigo's interface types work together, here's how you could implement and use a different evaluator such as Otto:

1. In your own module, create a new struct, ``MyEvaluator``
1. Decide if the language requires compilation; if it does, implement the ExpressionCompiler interface, including converting types from Indigo types to the evaluator's types. 
1. Implement the ExpressionEvaluator interface
1. When instantiating indigo.DefaultEngine, pass ``MyEvaluator``

Now, when you call indigo.DefaultEngine.Compile or .Evaluate, it will use your evaluator with your expression language.
